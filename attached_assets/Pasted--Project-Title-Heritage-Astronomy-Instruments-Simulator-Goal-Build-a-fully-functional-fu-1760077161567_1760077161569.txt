> *Project Title:* Heritage Astronomy Instruments Simulator
>
> *Goal:* Build a fully functional, full-stack web application that showcases interactive 3D models of historical Indian astronomical instruments: *Samrat Yantra, Bhitti Yantra, and Nadi Valaya Yantra*. Users should be able to:
>
> 1. Input *latitude and longitude* in India to dynamically generate instrument dimensions.
> 2. View *3D models* of instruments that are interactive (rotate, zoom, pan).
> 3. Run *simulations* showing how these instruments track celestial objects (e.g., shadow movement, angular measurements, time tracking).
> 4. Learn about the instruments’ *historical and astronomical significance*.
>
> *Frontend Requirements:*
>
> * Use *React.js, **Three.js, **Tailwind CSS*, HTML, and CSS.
> * Pages: Home, Simulation, About Instruments.
> * Components: Header, Footer, InstrumentCard, Simulator.
> * Load *3D models dynamically* using Three.js.
> * Responsive and modern *UI/UX theme* inspired by *heritage and astronomy*.
> * Users can manipulate *time in simulations* to see dynamic behavior of instruments.
>
> *Backend Requirements:*
>
> * Use *Python Flask* for API development.
> * Endpoints:
>
>   1. /api/instruments → Returns list of instruments and metadata.
>   2. /api/dimensions → Accepts latitude and longitude, returns dynamically calculated dimensions for Samrat Yantra, Bhitti Yantra, and Nadi Valaya Yantra.
> * Use *NumPy, Pandas, and math libraries* for calculations.
> * Optional database (SQLite or JSON) to store instrument info and reference historical data.
>
> *3D Models:*
>
> * Create models** of Samrat Yantra, Bhitti Yantra, and Nadi Valaya Yantra.
> * Models should be *accurate but simplified* for web rendering.
> * Include interaction: rotation, zoom, pan, and basic animation for simulation (shadow movement, star tracking).
>
> 
>
> *Simulation Features:*
>
> * Dynamically generate *shadow of Samrat Yantra* based on latitude, time, and date.
> * Show *tracking arcs for Bhitti Yantra and Nadi Valaya Yantra* to demonstrate celestial movement.
> * Users can adjust *time of day* and see real-time updates on instruments.
>
> *Deployment & Platform:*
>
> * Entire project should be deployable on *Replit*.
> * Include *all dependencies* (requirements.txt for backend, package.json for frontend).
> * Ensure *frontend-backend connection worksI*.
>
> *Deliverables (Copy-Paste Ready):*
>
> 1. Full *React.js frontend code* with Tailwind styling and Three.js integration.
> 2. Full *Python Flask backend code* with endpoints, calculations, and optional database.
> 3.  3D models** for all three instruments or instructions to generate.
> 4. *Integration code* connecting frontend and backend.
> 5. *Simulation logic* for instrument behavior (shadows, angles, celestial tracking).
> 6. Fully functional *responsive UI/UX* theme: Heritage + Astronomy.
> 7. Clear instructions for running the project on *Replit*.
>8. Astronomical Calendar - that will predict the upcoming events(solastics , eclipse etc)
> *Extra Challenge:*
>
> * Make the simulation *interactive*: users can rotate instruments, adjust time, input location, and see dynamic behavior.
> * Include *educational tooltips* describing each instrument and its purpose.
>
> *Final Output Expectation:*
>
> * A *full-stack web app* with interactive 3D models of Samrat, Bhitti, and Nadi Valaya Yantras.
> * Dynamic simulation based on *latitude, longitude, and time*.
> * Elegant, modern, and culturally themed UI.
> * Fully ready to deploy and run on *Replit* with all code, models, and instructions.
